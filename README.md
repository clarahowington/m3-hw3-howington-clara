Assignment 3
Challenges:
I had difficulty with fully understanding the concepts. I'm not sure if I was able to accurately use the nesting styles. When I tried to nest the Nav as #nav and include the "ul" and "li" below it, the code would break. Also when trying to make the website mobile responsive with @media, the code wouldn't work unless I put "!important" after the function.
